    "### How it Works\n",
    "\n",
    "The EQL model (`SymbolicNet`) is a neural network where activation functions are replaced with a library of primitive mathematical functions (e.g., `sin`, `x^2`, `x`, `*`). The network learns to combine these functions to fit the data. By applying L1 regularization (using the `--reg_weight` argument), we force the network to use as few connections as possible, resulting in a sparse, simple, and interpretable final equation."
